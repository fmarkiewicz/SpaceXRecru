      "Part of the Explorers program, this space telescope is intended for wide-field search of exoplanets transiting nearby stars. It is the first NASA high priority science mission launched by SpaceX. It was the first time SpaceX launched a scientific satellite not primarily intended for Earth observations. The second stage placed it into a high-Earth elliptical orbit, after which the satellite's own booster will perform complex maneuvers including a lunar flyby, and over the course of two months, reach a stable, 2:1 resonant orbit with the Moon. In January 2018, SpaceX received NASA's Launch Services Program Category 2 certification of its Falcon 9 'Full Thrust', certification which is required for launching medium risk missions like TESS. It was the last launch of a new Block 4 booster, and marked the 24th successful recovery of the booster. An experimental water landing was performed in order to attempt fairing recovery.",

      "This mission delivered the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) to the ISS, along with the MUSES Earth imaging platform and ROSA solar array. For the first time, this mission launched a refurbished Dragon capsule, serial number C106 which first flew in September 2014 on the CRS-4 mission. Originally scheduled to launch on June 1, but was scrubbed due to inclement weather.",
